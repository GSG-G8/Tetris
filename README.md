## Summary

Tetris a react game which allows the player to create complete lines by moving differently-shaped pieces â€“ the tetrominoes, which scroll from the top to bottom of the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled to the point that additional pieces can no longer descend. The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.
